# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
  Utilize Test Driven Development
  Practice Algorithmic Thinking
  Create an Object Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
  Work in a pair
  Use Pull Requests to collaborate with a partner
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  
  We feel that we should use pair programming because it allows us to collaborate and learn more from each other.
  
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?

  Zoom and slack will work just fine.
  
* How would you describe your work style?

  Aidan- I like to work with people, but I can do pretty well on my own.  Distractions outside of work, however, definitely disrupt my workflow.
  
  Kevin - I like to work alone and in a team environment. Not in an environment where I can easily be destracted.  
  
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?

  Aidan- Good at coding, thinking around problems
  
  Kevin - Work ethic and problem solver.
  
  Our strengths compliment each other by combining good work ethic and coding fluency to make a smooth workflow that operates in a timely manner.
  
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?

  Well- Done in a timely manner, good coding practices, completed for both
  
  Poorly- made large/complex methods, overworking/perfectionism
  
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
  
  Discussion with reasoning, collaboration
  
* How will we overcome obstacles?

  Discuss and/or compromise for a good solution
  
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

  Good environment, scheduling, communication
  
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  
  Finish before 12 AM EDT for Kevin to go to bed
  
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  
  Aidan - guided discovery. When the other person has had a bad day.
  
  Kevin - positive feedfoward. No, nothing hold me back.
  
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

  Kevin - Syntax and testing. I can improve in my logic in certain situations. Giving feedback can improve these skillls.

  Aidan - I am strong with logical operations and scope, and I could use improvement with knowledge of included ruby methods.  Support will happen as we go along in the class syllabus, so I am not concerned with that.

* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
  * Git/Github
  * VS Code Live Share for remote collaboration
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  
  If we cannot solve it ourselves, we will go on Slack then to mentors for help.
  
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?

  We will know if the project is successful if we get through at least Iteration 3 and the accompanying rubric requirements.
  
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

  We will send each other a picture of our pets when we finish something we feel good about.

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)

  Headphones on, phone on silent, no unnecessary interruptions by other people, video on for accountability

* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments? 

  Neither of us have had significant distractions so far, but when one occurs, we will do our best to address it.

* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype. 

  We are not anticipating anything going wrong, but if it does, we can slack each other to figure something out.

* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?

  52 mins on, 8 off for longer work sequences, using https://www.marinaratimer.com/nyMr2P2

* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?

  At the beginning of every work session, we will check in and see how we are doing.

Day 1 Agenda: 

  * do DTR
  * Define project and outline, more than once
  * Set up repo
  * Scheduling
